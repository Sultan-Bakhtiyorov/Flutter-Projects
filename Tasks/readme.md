# Dart Console Apps

This repository contains three simple Dart console applications.

## 1. Personal Information App

This app prompts the user to enter their name, surname, and faculty. It then prints out a welcome message.

## 2. Age Calculator

This app takes user input for name, surname, and year of birth, and calculates and displays the user's age.

## 3. Number Classifier

This app asks the user to input a number and then classifies it as positive, negative, or zero.

Each code file (`main.dart`) is well-commented for clarity.
